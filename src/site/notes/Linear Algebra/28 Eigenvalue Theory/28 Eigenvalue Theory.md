# 28 Eigenvalue Theory
We have now seen a real-world modeling problem ([[Linear Algebra/27 Standard Eigenvalue Problem/27.4 The Coupled Pendula Problem\|27.4 The Coupled Pendula Problem]]) that can be modeled as [[Linear Algebra/27 Standard Eigenvalue Problem/27.1 The Standard Eigenvalue Problem\|27.1 The Standard Eigenvalue Problem]]. 
$$
A \textcolor{red}{\vec{x}} = \textcolor{red}{\lambda \vec{x}}
$$
Recall that we developed this problem as part of our larger approach to analyzing dynamical systems in real-world problems. This lesson will focus on how we can use eigenvalues to solve more real world problems.

> [!question] Eigenvalue Questions
> When focusing on the mathematical analysis phase of our applied math modeling process involving eigenvalue problems, some questions that may arise are:
> - How does the algebraic structure of a matrix relate to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of that matrix?
> - How many eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs does a given $n \times n$ matrix have?
> - What do the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix tell us about that matrix?
> - When we use eigenvalue theory to solve applied problems, what insights can we gain from our knowledge of eigenvalues? How can we use this in practice?
