> [!definition|*] Entry-by-Entry Definition of an $m \times n$ Matrix
> Let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$. An $m \times n$ **matrix** is a rectangular array of $m \cdot n$ real numbers organized into $m$ rows and $n$ columns. We can write the general structure of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ as:
> 
> $$
> A = \begin{bmatrix}
> a_{11} & a_{12} & \dots & a_{1n} \\
> a_{21} & a_{22} & \dots & a_{2n} \\
> \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
> a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \dots & a_{mn}
> \end{bmatrix}
> $$
> - Each of the numbers in this array is called an **entry**, **element**, or **coefficient** of the matrix. 
> - Each entry has a row and column index which identifies where in the matrix that coefficient is stored
> 
> This is known as the entry-by-entry definition because we literally specified each entry in defining matrix $A$.

**Remark.** Each individual entry/element/coefficient of matrix $A$ has three pieces of information:
$$
\begin{align}
 & a_{ik} & i \in [m]  & &   k \in [n]
\end{align}
$$
1. Row index $i \in \{ 1,2, \dots, m \}$
2. Column index $k \in \{ 1,2, \dots, n \}$
3. Real-valued number $a_{ik} \in \mathbb{R}$

The value $a_{ik}$ is called the entry/element/coefficient of the matrix.

**Remark.** From our definition above, notice that all vectors are matrices but not all matrices are vectors.
