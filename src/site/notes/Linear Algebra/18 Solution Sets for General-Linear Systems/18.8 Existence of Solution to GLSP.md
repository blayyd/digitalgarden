> [!theorem|*] Existence of Solution to $A \cdot \textcolor{red}{\vec{x}} = \vec{b}$

> Suppose $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n }$ and $\vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{m }$ are "given." Then, the linear system $A \cdot \textcolor{red}{\vec{x}} = \vec{b}$ has a solution iff

**Remark.** In other words, a solution to [[Linear Algebra/17 General Linear-Systems/17.1 The General Linear-Systems Problem\|17.1 The General Linear-Systems Problem]] exists iff the vector $\vec{b}$ can be written as a [[Linear Algebra/06 Span and Linear Independence/6.1 Linear Combination of Vectors\|6.1 Linear Combination of Vectors]] of the columns of $A$.
