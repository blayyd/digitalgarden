> [!definition|*] Positive Definite Matrix
> 
> We say that an $n \times n$ matrix $K$ is **positive definite** iff it satisfies the two conditions:
> 1. Symmetry condition: $K = K^{T}$
> 2. Positivity condition: If $\vec{x} \neq  \vec{0}$, then $\vec{x}^{T} K \vec{x} > 0$
> 
> For short hand, we sometimes write $K > 0$ to imply that $K$ is a symmetric, positive definite matrix.
