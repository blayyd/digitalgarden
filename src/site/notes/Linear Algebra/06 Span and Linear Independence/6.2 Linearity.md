> [!definition|*] Linearity
> In Linear Algebra, **linearity** of a function is only valid when the function involves:
> - [[Linear Algebra/04 Vector Arithmetic/4.1 Scalar-Vector Multiplication\|4.1 Scalar-Vector Multiplication]]
> - [[Linear Algebra/04 Vector Arithmetic/4.2 Column Vector Addition\|4.2 Column Vector Addition]]
> 
> Anything else would be considered a nonlinear function.
