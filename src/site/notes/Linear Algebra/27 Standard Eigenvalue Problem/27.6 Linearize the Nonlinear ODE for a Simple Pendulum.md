In [[Linear Algebra/27 Standard Eigenvalue Problem/27.5 Motion of a Single Pendulum\|27.5 Motion of a Single Pendulum]], we derived the ordinary [[Differential Equations\|Differential Equations]] 
$$
\begin{align*}
\textcolor{red}{\ddot{\theta}(t)} + \frac{\textcolor{blue}{g}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}} \sin (\textcolor{red}{\theta(t)}) &=  0\\
\frac{ \mathrm{d}^{2} }{ \mathrm{d}t^{2} } [\textcolor{red}{\theta(t)}] + \frac{\textcolor{blue}{g}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}} \sin (\textcolor{red}{\theta(t)}) &= 0

$$
whose solution encodes the angle $\textcolor{red}{\theta(t)}$ made between the cord and the vertical position. Unfortunately, this equation is not easily solved. We cannot write a solution
$$
\textcolor{red}{\theta(t)} = ?
$$
in terms of elementary functions. However, using Linear Algebra, we can break this problem down into a much easier problem to solve.

However, what if instead of using the arc length, we used the position of the shadow along the ruler? Instead of working in a multidimensional space, we can work in a single dimensional space.

`\begin{proof}[Solution.]`

Recall that
$$
\sin(\textcolor{red}{\theta(t)}) = \frac{\textcolor{red}{u(t)}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}} = \frac{\textcolor{red}{\text{opposite}}}{\textcolor{blue}{ \text{hypotenuse}}}
$$
This implies that we can substitute
$$
\begin{align*}
\textcolor{red}{\ddot{\theta}(t)}+ \frac{\textcolor{blue}{g}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}} \sin (\textcolor{red}{\theta(t)}) &=  0\\
\implies \textcolor{red}{\ddot{\theta}(t)} + \frac{\textcolor{blue}{g}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}} \cdot \frac{\textcolor{red}{u(t)}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}} &= 0
\end{align*}
$$
However,
$$
\sin (\textcolor{red}{\theta(t)}) = \frac{\textcolor{red}{u(t)}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}}
$$
doesn't immediately suggest how to relate second order terms
$$
\textcolor{red}{\ddot{\theta}(t)} \text{ and } \textcolor{red}{\ddot{u}(t)}
$$
But, recall from our work with Taylor Series polynomials:
$$
\begin{align*}
\sin(\textcolor{red}{\theta}) &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k}}{2(k+1)!} [\textcolor{red}{\theta}]^{2k+1}\\
&= \textcolor{red}{\theta} \underbrace{ - \frac{1}{3!} \textcolor{red}{\theta^{3}} + \frac{1}{5!}\textcolor{red}{\theta^{5}}-\dots }_{ \text{as long as } \theta \text{ is small, these terms are close to zero} }
\end{align*}
$$
In other words, the error between the values of $\sin(\textcolor{red}{\theta})$ and $\textcolor{red}{\theta}$ is negligible for small values of $\textcolor{red}{\theta}$.
$$
= \textcolor{red}{\theta} + \underbrace{ O(\textcolor{red}{\theta^{3}}) }_{ \text{big $O$ notation} }
$$
Note that it is common practice to assume
$$
\textcolor{red}{\theta(t)} < 0.1 \text{ radian } \approx 7^{\circ}
$$
yielding an approximation error $< 0.1\%$.

Or, the tangent line to $\sin(\textcolor{red}{\theta})$ at expansion point $a=0$, defined by the linearization
$$
\begin{align*}
L(\textcolor{red}{\theta}) &= f(a) + f'(a) \cdot (\textcolor{red}{\theta}-a)\\
&= \sin (0) + \cos(0) \cdot (\textcolor{red}{\theta}-0)\\
&= 0 + 1 \cdot \textcolor{red}{ \theta}\\
&= \textcolor{red}{ \theta}
\end{align*}
$$
closely approximates the behavior of sine.
$$
\implies \textcolor{red}{\theta(t)} \approx \sin(\textcolor{red}{\theta(t)}) = \frac{\textcolor{red}{u(t)}}{ \textcolor{blue}{\ell}}
$$
This is known as the *small angle assumption*. 
$$
\begin{align*}
\implies \textcolor{red}{\dot{\theta}(t)} &= \frac{ \mathrm{d} }{ \mathrm{d}t } \textcolor{red}{\theta(t)}\\
&\approx \frac{ \mathrm{d} }{ \mathrm{d}t } \frac{\textcolor{red}{u(t)}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}}\\
&= \frac{1}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}} \cdot \frac{ \mathrm{d} }{ \mathrm{d}t } \textcolor{red}{u(t)}\\
&= \frac{\textcolor{red}{\dot{u}(t)}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}}\\
\\
\implies \textcolor{red}{\ddot{\theta}(t)} &= \frac{ \mathrm{d} }{ \mathrm{d}t } \textcolor{red}{\dot{\theta}(t)}\\
&\approx \frac{ \mathrm{d} }{ \mathrm{d}t } \frac{\textcolor{red}{\dot{u}(t)}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}}\\
&= \frac{1}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}} \frac{ \mathrm{d} }{ \mathrm{d}t } \textcolor{red}{\dot{u}(t)}\\
&= \frac{\textcolor{red}{\ddot{u}(t)}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}}
\end{align*}
$$
Then, using this approximation, we can state the linearized differential equation
$$
\begin{align*}
\textcolor{red}{\ddot{\theta}(t)} + \frac{\textcolor{blue}{g}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}} \sin (\textcolor{red}{\theta(t)}) &= 0\\
\frac{\textcolor{red}{\ddot{u}(t)}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}} + \frac{\textcolor{blue}{g}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}} \cdot \frac{\textcolor{red}{u(t)}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}} &= 0\\
\implies \textcolor{red}{\ddot{u}(t)} + \frac{\textcolor{blue}{g}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}} \cdot \textcolor{red}{u(t)} &= 0
\end{align*}
$$
 This transformed equation is also a way to state Newton's Second Law. For small angle oscillations with $\textcolor{red}{\theta(t)}<0.1$, we can set
 $$
\begin{align*}
\textcolor{red}{u(t)} &= \sin(\textcolor{red}{\theta(t)}) \approx \textcolor{red}{\theta(t)}\\
\implies \vec{f}_{g_{t}\perp} &= -\textcolor{blue}{m} \cdot \textcolor{blue}{g} \cdot \sin (\textcolor{red}{\theta(t)})\\
&= - \textcolor{blue}{m} \cdot \textcolor{blue}{ g} \cdot \frac{\textcolor{red}{u(t)}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}}\\
&= - \frac{{\textcolor{blue}{m} \cdot \textcolor{blue}{g}}}{\textcolor{blue}{\ell}} \textcolor{red}{u(t)}\\
&= \vec{f}_{p_{u}}
\end{align*}
$$
 `\end{proof}`
