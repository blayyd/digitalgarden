> [!definition|*] Row Vector
> Row vectors are horizontal arrays of numbers. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ be a positive integer. The vector $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times n}$ given by

> $$
> \vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
> x_{1} & x_{2} & \dots & x_{n}

> is a **row vector** with $n$ entries, $x_{k} \in \mathbb{R}$ for $k \in \{ 1,2, \dots, n \}$, organized in 1 row and $n$ columns.

**Remark.** When referring to a row vector $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times n}$, the superscript on $\mathbb{R}$ represents the dimensions $1 \times n$ of the given vector. 
- $1$ indicates the number of rows.
- $n$ indicates the number of columns.
- $\times$ separates the number of rows from the number of columns.

Thus, $\mathbb{R}^{1 \times n}$ is the set of vectors that have 1 row and $n$ columns.

 **Remark.** It is less common to refer specifically to row vectors. Thus, you should always write both dimensions when specifically referring to a row vector.
