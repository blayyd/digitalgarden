> [!definition|*] Sparse Matrices
> 
> Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$. The total number of elements of $A$ is denoted
> $$
> \text{numel}(A) = m \cdot n.
> $$
> The total number of nonzero elements in $A$ is $\text{nnz}(A)$. To count the number of zero elements, we can calculate
> $$
> \text{numel}(A)-\text{nnz}(A).
> $$
> We call a matrix **sparse** if 
> $$
> \frac{\text{nnz}(A)}{\text{numel}(A)} \leq 0.10 \text{ (approximately)}.

**Remark.** Sparse matrices are matrices that have much fewer zeros than you would expect.
