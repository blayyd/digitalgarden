# 01 Set Theory
Most results in applied linear algebra depend on a formal rigorous logical structure known as set theory. In this section, we study sets and introduce a general framework to state the many concepts and propositions we will need in applied linear algebra.

In lower-division calculus classes, functions are introduced without using set theoretic terminology. Instead, functions are referred to as a mappings that have at most three independent variables and a single, real-valued output. The functions are presented this way to bring more focus on the mathematical theory used to analyze these functions. However, with set theory, we can formalize the definition of a function. Instead of limiting ourselves to maps whose range is contained in the real number line, we can instead generalize functions as relationships between sets that satisfy important conditions.
