> [!definition|*] Inversion of a pair $(i,j)$ with respect to $\pi$

**Remark.** In other words, the pair $(i,j)$ is an inversion with respect to a given permutation $\pi$ if the outputs of $\pi(i)$ and $\pi(j)$ are in opposite orders of the inputs $i$ and $j$. A quick way to check if $(i,j)$ is an inversion with respect to $\pi$ is to calculate the ratio
$$
\frac{{\pi(i)-\pi(j)}}{i-j}
$$
 - If the ratio $< 0$, then $(i,j)$ is an inversion with respect to $\pi$.
 - If the ratio $> 0$, then $(i,j)$ is not an inversion with respect to $\pi$.
