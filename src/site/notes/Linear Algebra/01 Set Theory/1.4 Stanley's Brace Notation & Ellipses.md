The first description of the set suggests to the reader that we want to list all the integers from 1 to 10. The second description explicitly lists out the elements of the set. The benefit of using the ellipsis "$\dots$" is brevity and ease of reference. However, it is important to watch out for ambiguity when working with ellipsis.
