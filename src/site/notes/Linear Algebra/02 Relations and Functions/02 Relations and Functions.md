# 02 Relations and Functions
STEM professionals working in industry, government or academia often try to identify or create relationships between two different types of quantitative data. For example, digital cameras relate the intensity of light to voltages in an electric circuit. Linear Algebra provides elegant theoretic results about linear functions between two vector spaces. Because many relationships that exist in the real-world can be simplified into linear functions, we can apply the tools of linear algebra to solve real-world problems.
