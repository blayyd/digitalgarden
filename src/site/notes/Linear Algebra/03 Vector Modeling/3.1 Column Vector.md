> [!definition|*] Column Vector
> 
> Columns vectors are vertical arrays of real numbers.  Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A **column vector** $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}$ has $n$ real-valued entries, organized in $n$ rows and one column, in the form
> $$
> \vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
> x_{1} \\
> x_{2} \\
> \vdots \\
> x_{n}
> \end{bmatrix}.
> $$
> For each $i \in \{ 1,2,\dots,n \}$, the entry in the $i$th row of $\vec{x}$, labeled $x_{i}$, is a real number.

**Remark.** When writing $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}$, the superscript on $\mathbb{R}$ represents the dimensions of the vector $\vec{x}$.
- $n$ indicates the number of rows.
- $1$ indicates the number of columns.
- $\times$ separates the number of rows from the number of columns. <span style='float:right;'>$\blacklozenge$</span>

**Remark.** The subscript of a vector is used as an index variable. The first entry of a column vector is labeled $x_{1}$, and we increase the index variable by one as we move downwards through the rows. The entry in the last row is called $x_{n}$.
