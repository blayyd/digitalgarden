Then, the number of [[Linear Algebra/06 Span and Linear Independence/6.7 Linearly Independent Vectors\|linearly independent solutions]] to the [[Linear Algebra/18 Solution Sets for General-Linear Systems/18.3 Homogenous Linear System\|18.3 Homogenous Linear System]] problem

**Remark.** This is a helpful theorem from the standpoint of theory. To find the number of nonpivot columns of $A$, let
1. $p  = \#$ of pivot columns of $U$, where $U=\text{RREF}(A)$ is the [[Linear Algebra/17 General Linear-Systems/17.3 Reduced Row Echelon Form\|17.3 Reduced Row Echelon Form]] of $A$.
2. $p$ is the number of linearly independent columns of $A$.
3. The number of nonpivot columns of $A$ equals $d = (n-p)$.
4. The number of nonpivot columns of $A$ is the number of linearly dependent columns of $A$.
5. $d$ is the number of linearly independent solutions to the homogenous solution $A \cdot \vec{x} = \vec{ 0}$.
