Hello! Welcome to Sam's digital garden homepage.
> [!question] What is a digital garden? 
> A digital garden is a personal, online space where individuals curate, organize, and share their knowledge, ideas, and projects in a non-linear, evolving format. Unlike traditional blogs, digital gardens are continually updated and interconnected, resembling a web of thoughts rather than a chronological list of posts. My digital garden is written with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). You can find more information about how my math notes are written [[Obsidian Math Plugins\|here]].

 Here you will find a portfolio of my learning journey, primarily consisting of notes for subjects I am learning in college. If you spot an error in my work, feel free to let me know!
