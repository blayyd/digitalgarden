# 03 Vector Modeling
Vectors are the building blocks of all four [[Linear Algebra/00 Major Problems in Applied Linear Algebra/00 Major Problems in Applied Linear Algebra\|fundamental problems of applied linear algebra]]. Vectors are to linear algebra as what properties of real numbers are to calculus. Vectors and vector operations can be used to:
1. **Encode data:** Vectors store multidimensional data in compact form.
2. **Combine data:** Vector addition & scalar-vector multiplication combine known data to form new, related info
3. **Understand relationships:** The inner product of two vectors measures the angle between and indicates the degree to which one vector points in the same direction as another.
4. **Measure length and distance:** Vector norms measure the length of a vector and can be used to calculate distance between two vectors.
5. **Study algebraic properties:** By identifying algebraic properties of vector operations, we enable a theoretic approach to constructing vectors & vector operations.

> [!tldr] 
> - Vectors encode quantitative info. In linear algebra, this info is multidimensional data.
> - The two types of vectors we will be working with are column and row vectors.
