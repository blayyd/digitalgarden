> [!theorem|*] Test for Linear Dependence
> Let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose that $\vec{a}_{1}, \vec{a}_{2}, \dots, \vec{a}_{n} \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$. These vectors are [[Linear Algebra/06 Span and Linear Independence/6.4 Linearly Dependent Vectors\|6.4 Linearly Dependent Vectors]] iff there exists a set of scalars $x_{1}, x_{2}, \dots, x_{n}$ that are not all zero such that
> $$x_{1}\vec{a}_{1} + x_{2}\vec{a}_{2} + \dots + x_{n}\vec{a}_{n} = \vec{0}$$
> with at least one scalar $x_{i} \neq 0$.
