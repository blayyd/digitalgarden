> [!definition|*] The General Linear-Systems Problem
> 
> Let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$. Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be a given rectangular matrix and $\vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{m }$ be a given vector. Then, the **general linear-systems problem** is to find an unknown vector $\textcolor{red}{\vec{x}}\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that
> $$
> A \cdot \textcolor{red}{\vec{x}} = \vec{b}
> $$

**Remark.** Unlike [[Linear Algebra/12 Nonsingular Linear Systems/12.1 The Square Linear-Systems Problem\|12.1 The Square Linear-Systems Problem]], the GLSP uses a rectangular matrix which is not allowed to be nonsingular, Additionally, there are usually many (infinite!) number of solutions.
- ! Sometimes, a problem may start with a square matrix but the problem itself may still be a general linear systems problem. To be a nonsingular linear systems problem, the matrix MUST be nonsingular.

$$
\begin{align}
 & \text{NLSP or GLSP} & [A]_{n \times n}\textcolor{red}{[\vec{x}]_{n \times 1}}  & = [\vec{b}]_{n \times 1} \\
 & \text{GLSP} & \begin{bmatrix}
 & A & 
\end{bmatrix}_{m \times n} \textcolor{red}{\begin{bmatrix}
 \\
\vec{x} \\
 \\

\end{bmatrix}_{n \times 1}}  & = [\vec{b}]_{m \times 1} \\
 & \text{GLSP or Least Squares} & \begin{bmatrix}
 \\
A \\
 \\

\end{bmatrix}_{m \times n} \textcolor{red}{\begin{bmatrix}
\vec{x}
\end{bmatrix}_{n \times 1}}  & =\begin{bmatrix}
 \\
\vec{b} \\
 \\

\end{bmatrix}_{m \times 1}
\end{align}
$$
 However, the strategy we developed for solving the NLSP will be similar to our strategy for solving the GLSP.

**Remark.** Most times when we are solving the GLSP, we are thinking about short, wide matrices that provide an infinite number of solutions.
