> [!example|*] Traffic Control System Relation
> Suppose we are designing a way to control traffic. We want to know how we can use symbols to direct traffic. 
> $$
> \begin{align*}
> A &=  \{ 游릭,游댮 \}  \\
> B &=  \{ \text{STOP, GO} \} \\
> \implies A \times B &= \{ (游릭, \text{STOP}),(游릭, \text{GO}),(游댮, \text{STOP}),(游댮, \text{GO}) \}
> \end{align*}
> $$

*Solution.* We decide the relation would be:
$$
R = \{ (游릭, \text{GO}), (游댮, \text{STOP}) \}
$$
**Remark.** Note that $R \subset A \times B$. In this case, we've used the set theoretic version for relations to establish a solution to our traffic control problem.
