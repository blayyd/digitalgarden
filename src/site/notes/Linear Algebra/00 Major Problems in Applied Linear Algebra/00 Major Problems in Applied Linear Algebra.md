# 00 Major Problems in Applied Linear Algebra
This section states the fundamental problems of introductory applied linear algebra. These problems are very important in many STEM fields. By learning how to solve the fundamental problems of introductory linear algebra, we set the foundations so that we may be able to solve these advanced problems. To make these connections explicit, we need to translate problems from the real world into useful mathematical concepts. 
> [!tldr] 
> - Learn how to use math to understand the world
> - Know the 4 fundamental problems
> - Find at least 3 major application areas where these problems show up
