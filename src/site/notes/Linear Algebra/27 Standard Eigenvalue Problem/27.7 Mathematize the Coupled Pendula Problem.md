> [!exercise|2] Formulate a modeling framework for our coupled pendula
>  Now that we understand a little more about the [[Linear Algebra/27 Standard Eigenvalue Problem/27.5 Motion of a Single Pendulum\|27.5 Motion of a Single Pendulum]], let's use that knowledge as a foundation to begin constructing a model of our coupled pendula system.

We begin our construction by placing two pendula together, side by side, on the same stable support structure.
