Some people like to use $|$ for the "such that". We will be avoiding this because it looks too similar to the norm symbol.
$$
\{ x \underset{ \text{avoid this} }{ | } P(x) \}
$$
In set builder notation, the name of the general element does not matter.
$$
\{ x : P(x) \} = \{ y: P(y) \} = \{ \theta : P(\theta) \}
$$

Written using [[Linear Algebra/01 Set Theory/1.2 Element Enumeration\|1.2 Element Enumeration]], we would write the elements of $T$ as:
$$
T = \{ 1,2,3,4,\dots,1024 \}
$$
The statement $-1 \in T$ would be a false statement. Note that $P(x)$ is the statement.
1. $\checkmark$ $x$ is an integer
2. $\text{X}$ $1 \leq x \leq 1024$

Therefore, $-1 \not\in T$ would be a true statement.
