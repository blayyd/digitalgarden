> [!theorem|*] Algebraic Properties of Matrix Transposes
> 
> Let matrices $A, B \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and $c \in \mathbb{R}$. Then, all of the following are properties of matrix transposes:
> 1. Two Transposes $\left((A)^{T}\right)^{T} = A$
> 2. Transpose of a Sum: $(A + B)^{T} = A^{T} + B^{T}$
> 3. Scalars come out of Transposes: $(cA)^{T} = cA^{T}$
> 4. Transpose of a Matrix Product: $(A \cdot B)^{T} = B^{T} \cdot A^{T}$
