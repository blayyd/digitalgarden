# 13 Invertible Matrices
This section will focus on matrix inverses, which relates to [[Linear Algebra/12 Nonsingular Linear Systems/12 Nonsingular Linear Systems\|12 Nonsingular Linear Systems]]:
$$
A_{n \times n} \textcolor{red}{\vec{x}_{n \times 1}} = \vec{b}_{n \times 1}
$$
- $A$ is nonsingular (linearly independent columns)
- nonsingular = invertible
