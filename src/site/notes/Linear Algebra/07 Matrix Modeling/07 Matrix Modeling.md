# 07 Matrix Modeling
Matrices are used to model things requiring multiple dimensions of data. Some applications that use matrices are:
- classical mechanics
- statics
- dynamics
- electromagnetism
- optics
- quantum mechanics
- computer graphics

This section will focus on some of the most accessible matrix modeling techniques. These will build the foundation for constructing matrices in later sections when the matrix models are more complex.
