> [!example] Element enumeration
> **Element enumeration** involves listing every element in the set. Let's define two sets.
> - Lower-case English letters:
> $$
> L = \{ a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z \}
> $$
> - Upper-case English letters:
> $$
> U = \{ A,B,C, \dots, Z \}
> $$

By definition of our sets, we see that lowercase letter "d" is an element of $L$ while "d" is not an element of $U$. 
- $d \in L$
- $d \not\in U$

Likewise, the upper case letter "Z" is not in $L$ but is in $U$.
