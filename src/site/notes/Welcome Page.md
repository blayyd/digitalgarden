Hello! Welcome to Sam's digital garden homepage.
> [!question] What is a digital garden? 
> A digital garden is a personal, online space where individuals curate, organize, and share their knowledge, ideas, and projects in a non-linear, evolving format. Unlike traditional blogs, digital gardens are continually updated and interconnected, resembling a web of thoughts rather than a chronological list of posts. This approach allows for a more organic exploration of topics, reflecting the growth and development of the creator‚Äôs understanding over time. Digital gardens often include notes, essays, and links to related content, providing a rich, interactive experience for both the creator and the audience.

Here you will find a portfolio of my learning journey, primarily consisting of subjects I am learning in college. Please note that I cannot guarantee 100% of the information to be correct. If you spot an error in my work, feel free to let me know! Constructive feedback is welcome.
