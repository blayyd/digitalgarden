Mathematical objects tend to have certain "certain types of links" to other concepts. 
- `Types`: *of functions (injections, surjections, etc.)*
- `Examples`: *of functions (worked problems, example of usage, etc.)*
- `Constructions`: *math objects constructed from the object (ex. related rates from derivation)*
- `Generalizations`: *abstractions (think of the bigger picture the topic comes from)*
- `Questions`: *questions about subject*
- `Properties`: *related properties*
- `Sufficiencies`: *requirements of another function/definition or required to know*

For example, a note called `Function.md`, which defines a function would have links like:
- `types` of functions (injections, surjections, etc.),
- `examples` of functions (functions in a topological/metric space),
- `constructions` (image, preimage, compositions, etc.),
- `generalizations` (morphisms, relations, etc.),
- `properties` (collection of all functions form a proper class),
- `sufficiencies` (certain conditions that guarantee certain properties of functions, say 'criteria for equality of functions', or other set-theoretic stuff that guarantees the existence of a function...)
