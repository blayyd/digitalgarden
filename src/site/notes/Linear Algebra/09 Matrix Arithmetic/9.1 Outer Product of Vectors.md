> Notice that row $i$ of the outer product $\vec{x}\vec{y}^{T}$ is given by $x_{i}\vec{y}^{T}$ for $i = 1,2,\dots,m$ while column $k$ of the outer product is given by $y_{k}\vec{x}$ for $k = 1,2,\dots,n$.

**Remark.** If $\vec{x},\vec{y} \neq 0$, then the resulting matrix is called a **rank 1 matrix** (rank counts the number of [[Linear Algebra/06 Span and Linear Independence/6.7 Linearly Independent Vectors\|linearly independent]] columns).
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x_{1}y_{1} & x_{1}y_{2} & \dots & x_{1}y_{n} \\
x_{2}y_{1} & x_{2}y_{2} & \dots & x_{2}y_{n} \\
 \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
x_{m}y_{1} & x_{m}y_{2} & \dots & x_{m}y_{n}
\end{bmatrix}

Let's look at $y$ values of the first column. They are all $y_{1}$. From this information, we can determine that the first column is a scalar multiple of the other columns, meaning that the columns are [[Linear Algebra/06 Span and Linear Independence/6.4 Linearly Dependent Vectors\|6.4 Linearly Dependent Vectors]]. Every single column is linearly dependent on the first column, or vice versa.
- & There is exactly one linearly dependent column in this matrix, so we call it a rank 1 matrix!

**Remark.** The outer product between vectors can be very useful for computing many multiplications between real numbers simultaneously. These matrices are also very helpful for creating new matrices.
