> [!theorem|*] Properties of Matrix Inverses
> 
> Let $A, B \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ be square, nonsingular matrices. Then, the following properties apply:
> 1. The matrix $A^{-1}$ is unique.
> 2. The linear-system problem $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ has a unique solution.
> 3. $A \cdot B$ is invertible and $(A \cdot B)^{-1} = B^{-1} \cdot A^{-1}$
> 4. $(A^{T})^{-1} = (A^{-1})^{T}=A^{-T}$
> 5. $A^{-1}$ can be written as a product of elementary matrices.
