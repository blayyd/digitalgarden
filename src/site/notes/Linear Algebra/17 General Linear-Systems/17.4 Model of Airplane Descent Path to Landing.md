# Set up the GLSP
Airplane landings typically follow a smooth curve. A linear line would be too sharp. A quadratic path would cause us to crash. However, a cubic polynomial seems to provide a smooth curve, which we will use to model the descent.
$$
p(x) = a_{0} + a_{1} x + a_{2} x^{2} + a_{3} x^{3}
$$
Our goal is to find the parameters $a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}$ that fit the path of our Boeing 787. To determine the unknown coefficients, we impose the following conditions.
$$
\begin{array}{| c | c | c |}
\hline \text{Condition \#}  & \text{Verbal Description} & \text{Equation} \\
\hline 1. & \text{The cruising altitude is 40000 ft}  & p(0)=40000\\
 &  \text{at the start of the descent.} \\
\hline 2.  & \text{The landing point has an altitude} & p(400)=0 \\
 & \text{of 0.} \\
\hline 3.  & \text{The tangent line to the descent}  & p'(0)=0\\
 & \text{path is horizontal at the start.} \\
\hline 4.  & \text{The tangent line to the descent}  & p'(400)=0\\
 & \text{path is horizontal at the landing.} \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$
Let's take a look at what each condition means.

## Condition 1
We start our landing process at 40000 ft in the air and we assume this is 0 miles. In other words, we begin with our first equation $p(0)=40000$. By substituting in $x=0$ and $p(0)=400000$, we see
$$
\begin{align*}
1 \cdot a_{0} + 0 \cdot a_{1} + 0 \cdot a_{2} + 0 \cdot a_{3} &= 40000
\end{align*}
$$
This is a linear equation based on the fact that we know the input and know the output. We can rewrite this as an [[Linear Algebra/05 Inner Products and Vector Norms/5.1 Inner Product Between Vectors\|5.1 Inner Product Between Vectors]].
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
a_{0} \\
a_{1} \\
a_{2} \\
a_{3}
\end{bmatrix}= 40000
$$

## Condition 2
We also know that our altitude will be 0 when we land. From our graph, we see that the altitude reaches 0 when $x$ is 400 miles. Plugging $x = 400$ and $p(400)=0$ into our cubic polynomial, we see
$$
1 \cdot a_{0} + 400 \cdot a_{1} + 400^{2} \cdot a_{2} + 400^{3} \cdot a_{3} = 0
$$
Once again, we can write this linear equation as an inner product.
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 400 & 400^{2} & 400^{3}
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
a_{0} \\
a_{1} \\
a_{2} \\
a_{3}
\end{bmatrix}=0
$$
Recall that matrices and vectors are data structures used to help us organize data. We can arrange our equations from conditions 1 and 2 into row form to produce [[Linear Algebra/17 General Linear-Systems/17.1 The General Linear-Systems Problem\|17.1 The General Linear-Systems Problem]].
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 400 & 400^{2} & 400^{3}
\end{bmatrix}_{2 \times 4} \begin{bmatrix}
a_{0} \\
a_{1} \\
a_{2} \\
a_{3}
\end{bmatrix}_{4 \times 1} = \begin{bmatrix}
40000 \\
0
\end{bmatrix}_{2 \times 1}
$$
When we have a short and wide matrix, we generally have too many (infinite!) possible solutions. We need to enforce more constraints to produce a meaningful solution.

## Condition 3
Before landing, we want our plane to be traveling horizontally. Mathematically, we can say we want the tangent line of our path to have 0 slope at the moment it starts to descend. Written using mathematical notation, we see
$$
p'(0)=0
$$
We can also take the derivative of our function $p(x)$.
$$
\begin{align*}
p(x)&= a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{3}x^{3}\\
\implies p'(x)&= a_{1}+2a_{2}x+3a_{3}x^{2}
\end{align*}
$$
When we substitute in $x=0$ and $p'(0)=0$, we get at third equation.
$$
0 \cdot a_{0} + 1 \cdot a_{1} + 2 \cdot 0 \cdot a_{2} + 3 \cdot 0^{2} \cdot a_{3} = 0
$$
- Note that we added $0 \cdot a_{0}$ so we can create a $4 \times 1$ [[Linear Algebra/03 Vector Modeling/3.4 Row Vector\|3.4 Row Vector]] of the scalars.

Once again, we can write this equation as an inner product.
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
a_{0} \\
a_{1} \\
a_{2} \\
a_{3}
\end{bmatrix} = 0
$$
This is now a third condition we can put into a matrix.

## Condition 4
We also want the tangent line at the end of the landing path to have a 0 slope. After all, we do not want to crash into the ground.
$$
p'(400) = 0
$$
We can plug this value into our equation for $p'(x)$.
$$
\begin{align*}
0 \cdot a_{0} + 400 \cdot a_{1} + 2 \cdot 400 \cdot a_{2} + 3 \cdot 400^{2} \cdot a_{3} &=  0\\
0 \cdot a_{0} + 1 \cdot a_{1} + 800 \cdot a_{2} + 480000 \cdot a_{3} &= 0
\end{align*}
$$
And written as an inner product we see
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 800 & 480000
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
a_{0} \\
a_{1} \\
a_{2} \\
a_{3}
\end{bmatrix} = 0
$$

## Combining Conditions
Let's combine all four of these equations into a single system.
$$
\begin{array}
 & 1 \cdot a_{0}  & +  &  0 \cdot a_{1}  & +  & 0 \cdot a_{2}  & +  & 0 \cdot a_{3}  & =40000 \\
1 \cdot a_{0} &  +  & 400 \cdot a_{1} & + & 160000 \cdot a_{2}  & + & 64000000 \cdot a_{3}  & = 0 \\
0 \cdot a_{0}  & + &  1 \cdot a_{1}  & + & 0 \cdot a_{2}  & + & 0 \cdot a_{3}  & = 0 \\
0 \cdot a_{0}  & + &  1 \cdot a_{1}  & + &  800 \cdot a_{2}  & + & 480000 \cdot a_{3}  & = 0
\end{array}
$$

Each equation can be stored as a product. We can organize these products using matrices to form the system.
$$
\underbrace{ \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 400 & 160000 & 64000000 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 800 & 480000
\end{bmatrix} }_{ A } \underbrace{ \begin{bmatrix}
a_{0} \\
a_{1} \\
a_{2} \\
a_{3}
\end{bmatrix} }_{ \vec{x} } = \underbrace{ \begin{bmatrix}
40000 \\
0 \\
0 \\
0
\end{bmatrix} }_{ \vec{b} }
$$
We have successfully set up a general linear-systems problem from a real world context. See [[Linear Algebra/17 General Linear-Systems/17.5 Solving GLSP for Airplane Descent  Path\|17.5 Solving GLSP for Airplane Descent  Path]] for the final solution to this modeling problem.
