> [!theorem|*] Algebraic Properties of Matrix-Matrix Multiplication
> 
> Let $A,B,C$ be matrices of appropriate sizes so that all of the following operations can be performed. Let $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ be any scalar. Then, all of the following are algebraic properties of matrix-matrix multiplication.
> 1. Associativity: $(AB)C=A(BC)$
> 2. Left distributivity: $A(B\pm C) = AB\pm AC$
> 3. Right distributivity: $(A\pm B)C=AC\pm BC$
> 4. Identity Matrix: $AI=A=IA$
> 5. Zero Matrix: $A 0 = 0 = 0A$
> 6. Transpose: $(AB)^{T}=B^{T}A^{T}$
> 7. Scalar Multiplication: $(\alpha A)B=A(\alpha B)$
