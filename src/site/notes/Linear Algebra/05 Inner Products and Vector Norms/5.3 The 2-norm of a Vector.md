> [!definition|*] The 2-norm of a Vector
> 
> Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ be a positive integer and let $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Then, the **2-norm** $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is given by the square root of the sum of the square of the elements.
> $$
> \lvert \lvert \vec{x} \rvert  \rvert _{2} = \sqrt{ x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2} }=\sqrt{ \sum_{j=1}^{n}x^{2}_{j} }
> $$
> Another way to calculate the **2-norm** is to take the [[Linear Algebra/05 Inner Products and Vector Norms/5.1 Inner Product Between Vectors\|5.1 Inner Product Between Vectors]] using the following formula:
> $$
> \lvert \lvert \vec{x} \rvert  \rvert _{2} = \sqrt{ \vec{x} \cdot \vec{x} }
> $$

**Remark.** The two-norm is also known as the euclidean norm.

 **Remark.** From this point on, the two norm will be denoted with the following notation:
 $$
\lvert \lvert \vec{x} \rvert  \rvert = \lvert \lvert \vec{x} \rvert  \rvert _{2} 
$$

 **Remark.** There are many other vector-norms two consider. However, we will focus on the 2-norm as it is the most important when it comes to introductory linear algebra.

 **Remark.** In Multivariable Calculus, the 2-norm of a Vector is also known as the *magnitude*.
