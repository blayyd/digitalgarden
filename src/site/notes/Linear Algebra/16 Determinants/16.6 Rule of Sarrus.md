**Remark.** Another way to think of Sarrus' rule is to imagine that the matrix is wrapped around a cylinder, such that the right and left edges are joined.

`\begin{proof}[Solution.]`
We can compute the determinant by following the steps of the Rule of Sarrus.

$$
\begin{align*}
\det(A)&=  \begin{array}{| c c c |c c}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & a_{11} & a_{12} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}  & a_{21} & a_{22}\\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} & a_{31} & a_{32}
\end{array} \\
&=  a_{11}a_{22}a_{33}+a_{12}a_{23}a_{31}+a_{13}a_{21}a_{32}\\
&- a_{13}a_{22}a_{31}-a_{11}a_{23}a_{32}-a_{12}a_{21}a_{33}
\end{align*}
$$
 `\end{proof}`
