> [!theorem|*] 
> Any list of $n$ vectors of size $m \times 1$ with $n > m$ is linearly dependent. 

**Remark.** In a linearly dependent set of vectors, at least one vector can be created from the other vectors in the set via [[Linear Algebra/06 Span and Linear Independence/6.1 Linear Combination of Vectors\|linear combination]].

 **Remark.** Linear dependence is connected to the study of the range of the [[Linear Algebra/10 Matrix-Vector Multiplication/10 Matrix-Vector Multiplication\|10 Matrix-Vector Multiplication]] problem. Given a set of vectors $\vec{a}_{1}, \vec{a}_{2}, \dots, \vec{a}_{n} \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$, we can take the [[Linear Algebra/06 Span and Linear Independence/6.3 Span of a set of vectors\|span]] of that set. Let $A$ be a matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns given by
 $$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
\vec{a}_{1} & \vec{a}_{2} & \dots & \vec{a}_{n}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$
The span of these vectors is the range of the matrix vector multiplication problem. A set of vectors is linearly dependent if we can delete one of the columns of our vector and produce the same range from the reduced matrix.
