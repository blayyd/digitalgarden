> Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ be a positive integer and let [[Linear Algebra/03 Vector Modeling/3.1 Column Vector\|3.1 Column Vector]] $\vec{x},\vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Then, the [[Linear Algebra/05 Inner Products and Vector Norms/5.1 Inner Product Between Vectors\|dot product]] satisfies
> $$
> \vec{x} \cdot \vec{y} = \lvert \lvert \vec{x} \rvert  \rvert \: \lvert \lvert \vec{y} \rvert  \rvert \cos \theta
