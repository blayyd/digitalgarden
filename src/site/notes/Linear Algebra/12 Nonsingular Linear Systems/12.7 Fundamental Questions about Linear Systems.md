> [!definition|*] Fundamental Questions about Linear Systems
> - **Existence Question:** Is the system of equations consistent? Does the linear system have at least one solution?
> - **Uniqueness Question:** If a solution exists, is it the only one? Does the linear system have a unique solution?

**Remark.** These are some important questions to ask yourself when solving linear systems problems.
