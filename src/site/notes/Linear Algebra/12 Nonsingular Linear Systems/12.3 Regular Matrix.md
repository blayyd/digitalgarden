> Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ be a "given" square matrix. We say $A$ is **regular** if it reduces to an [[Linear Algebra/08 Anatomy of Matrices/8.9 Upper-Triangular Matrix\|8.9 Upper-Triangular Matrix]] $U$ with all non-zero pivots in the diagonal elements using ONLY multiplication by [[Linear Algebra/09 Matrix Arithmetic/9.8 Shear Matrix\|9.8 Shear Matrix]].
> - A regular matrix is pretty much the easiest type of matrix to reduce.
> - The process of reducing regular matrices is known as **regular Gaussian Elimination**.

**Remark.** Note that regular matrices are a special subclass of matrices. In general, more sophisticated reduction algorithms will be necessary to deal with with non-regular and non-square matrices.
