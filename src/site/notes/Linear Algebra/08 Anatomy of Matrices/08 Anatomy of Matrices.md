# 08 Anatomy of Matrices
This section focuses on multiple features of matrix notation and categorizes powerful patterns in the anatomy of matrices. By identifying special structures within the entries of a matrix, we can create efficient solutions to our [[Linear Algebra/00 Major Problems in Applied Linear Algebra/00 Major Problems in Applied Linear Algebra\|00 Major Problems in Applied Linear Algebra]].
