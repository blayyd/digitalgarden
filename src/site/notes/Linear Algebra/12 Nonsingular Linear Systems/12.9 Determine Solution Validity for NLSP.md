> [!theorem|*] Determine Solution Validity for NLSP
> Let matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and vector $\vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$  be "given." Suppose we want to find the [[Linear Algebra/12 Nonsingular Linear Systems/12.8 Solution Set to Square Linear-Systems Problem\|12.8 Solution Set to Square Linear-Systems Problem]] $A \vec{x} = \vec{b}$. Then, there are only three possible scenarios:
> 1. Empty solution set: no exact solutions exist
> 2. One element solution set: a unique solution exists
> 3. Infinite solution set: non-unique solutions exist
> 
> If $A$ is nonsingular, the square linear-systems problem will ALWAYS have a unique solution.
