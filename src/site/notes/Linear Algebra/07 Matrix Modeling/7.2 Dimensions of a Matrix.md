> [!definition|*]  Dimensions of a Matrix
> The **size** of a matrix $A$ is given in the form $m \times n$, where $m$ $i$ $s$ the number of rows and $n$ gives the number of columns of the matrix. 
> - $m$ is the number on the left of the $\times$ symbol, known as the **row dimension** of the matrix
> - $n$ is the number on the right of the $\times$ symbol, known as the **column dimension** of the matrix
