> [!definition|*] Relation
> 
> Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. The set $R$ is a **relation from $A$ to $B$** iff
> $$
> R \subseteq A \times B.
> $$
> - A relation from $A$ to itself is called **a relation on $A$**. 
> - If $(a,b) \in R$, we write $a \space R \space b$ and say that $a$ is **related** to $b$. 
> - If $(a,b) \not\in R$, then $a \space \cancel{ R } \space b$.
