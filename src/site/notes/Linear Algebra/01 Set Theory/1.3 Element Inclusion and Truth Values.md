In set notation, brackets have very special meaning.
- $\{$ left bracket
- $\}$ right bracket

Additionally, in set notation, the order of elements doesn't matter.
$$
\begin{align*}
L_{v} &= \{ a,e,i,o,u \}\\
&= \{ u,o,i,e,a \}\\
&= \{ i,o,a,u,e \}
\end{align*}
$$
The number of appearances doesn't matter either.
$$
L_{v} = \{ e,i,e,i,o,a,u \}
$$
The only defining characteristic that matters is whether or not an element is included in the set (aka ==set inclusion==). To denote inclusion, we use the **set membership symbol**.
- $x \in A$ is true if element $x$ is inside set $A$
- $x \in A$ is false if $x$ is not in set $A$ (in which case $x \not\in A$ is true)
