> [!definition|*] Linearly Independent Vectors
> 
> Let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose that vectors $\vec{a}_{1},\vec{a}_{2}, \dots, \vec{a}_{n} \in \mathbb{R}^{M}$ and scalars $x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n} \in \mathbb{R}$. The set $\{ \vec{a}_{k} \}^{n}_{k=1 }$ of vectors is **linearly independent** if it is NOT [[Linear Algebra/06 Span and Linear Independence/6.4 Linearly Dependent Vectors\|linearly dependent]].
