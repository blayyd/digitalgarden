> [!definition|*] Function in Set Theory
> 
> A **function from $A$ to $B$** is a [[Linear Algebra/02 Relations and Functions/2.3 Relation\|relation]] $f$ from $A$ to $B$ such that both of the following hold:
> 1. $\text{Dom}(f) = A = \text{Domain space}(f)$
> 2. If $(x,y) \in f$ and $(x,z) \in f$, then $y = z$.
> 
> We denote the phrase "$f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$" with the notation $f:A\to B$. 
> - If $B=A$, we say that $f$ is a **function on** $A$.

**Remark.** All functions are relations. However, not all relations are functions.

 **Remark.** The domain of a function is the [[Linear Algebra/01 Set Theory/1.1 Set\|1.1 Set]] of all inputs.
