> Suppose $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is "given." Suppose $A$ has a total of $0 \leq d \leq n$ nonpivot columns. Let $\vec{z}_{1}, \vec{z}_{2}, \dots, \vec{z}_{d}$ be [[Linear Algebra/06 Span and Linear Independence/6.4 Linearly Dependent Vectors\|linearly independent solutions]] to the homogenous linear equation $A \cdot \textcolor{red}{\vec{x}}= \vec{0}$. In other words, let
