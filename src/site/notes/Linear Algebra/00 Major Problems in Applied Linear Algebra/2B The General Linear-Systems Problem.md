> [!question] Problem 2B: The General Linear-Systems Problem
> Let $m$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be a given rectangular matrix and $\vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ be a "given" vector. Then, the general linear systems problem is to find an unknown vector $\textcolor{red}{\vec{x}} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that:
> $$
> A \cdot \textcolor{red}{\vec{x}} = \vec{b}
> $$

The reason we break problem 2 into this and [[Linear Algebra/00 Major Problems in Applied Linear Algebra/2A The Nonsingular Linear-Systems Problem\|2A The Nonsingular Linear-Systems Problem]] is to specify which model to use. Most of the technique used to solve general linear-systems problems are built on intuition from:
- [[Linear Algebra/00 Major Problems in Applied Linear Algebra/1 The Matrix-Vector Multiplication Problem\|1 The Matrix-Vector Multiplication Problem]]
- [[Linear Algebra/00 Major Problems in Applied Linear Algebra/2A The Nonsingular Linear-Systems Problem\|2A The Nonsingular Linear-Systems Problem]]

We will primarily focus on [[Linear Algebra/00 Major Problems in Applied Linear Algebra/2A The Nonsingular Linear-Systems Problem\|2A The Nonsingular Linear-Systems Problem]] because Problem 2B can be transformed into [[Linear Algebra/00 Major Problems in Applied Linear Algebra/2A The Nonsingular Linear-Systems Problem\|2A The Nonsingular Linear-Systems Problem]] combined with [[Linear Algebra/00 Major Problems in Applied Linear Algebra/1 The Matrix-Vector Multiplication Problem\|1 The Matrix-Vector Multiplication Problem]]. Through this, we are transforming a difficult problem into a nonsingular-linear systems problem.
