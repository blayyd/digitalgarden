Just like regular arithmetic operations, there are a number of algebraic properties for matrix operations.
> [!theorem|*] Algebraic Properties of Matrix Operations
> Let matrices $A, B, C, \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and scalars $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$. Then, all of the following are properties of matrix addition:
> 1. Commutativity of matrix addition: $A + B = B + A$
> 2. Associativity of matrix: $A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C$
> 3. Additive Identity: $A + 0 = 0 + A = A$
> 4. Additive Inverses: $A + -A = -A + A = 0$
> 5. Distributivity of matrix addition: $a(A+B) = aA+aB$
> 6. Distributivity of scalar addition: $(a+b)A = aA + bA$
> 7. Associativity of scalar multiplication: $a(bA) = (ab)A$
> 8. Multiplicative Identity of scalar multiplication: $1A = A$

**Remark.** Notice how the properties of matrix addition and scalar-matrix multiplication are the exact same as the [[Linear Algebra/04 Vector Arithmetic/4.3 Algebraic Properties of Vector Arithmetic\|4.3 Algebraic Properties of Vector Arithmetic]].
