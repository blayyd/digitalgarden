> [!definition|*] Entries of a Matrix
> - A **zero** entry of a matrix is an entry $a_{ik}=0$
> - A **nonzero** entry of a matrix is an entry $a_{ik}\neq 0$
> - The **leading entry** of a row of a matrix is the first nonzero element in that row when reading from left to right (this is a nonzero entry of a row with smallest column index).

**Remark.** Leading entries are used in solution techniques for [[Linear Algebra/00 Major Problems in Applied Linear Algebra/2B The General Linear-Systems Problem\|2B The General Linear-Systems Problem]], [[Linear Algebra/00 Major Problems in Applied Linear Algebra/3 The Full-Rank Least-Squares Problem\|3 The Full-Rank Least-Squares Problem]], and [[Linear Algebra/00 Major Problems in Applied Linear Algebra/4 The Standard Eigenvalue Problem\|4 The Standard Eigenvalue Problem]].
