> [!definition|*] Linearly Dependent Vectors

> Let $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose $\vec{a}_{1},\vec{a}_{2}, \dots, \vec{a}_{n} \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$. We say that the set of vectors $\{ \vec{a}_{k} \}_{k=1}^{n}$ is **linearly dependent** if and only if one of the vectors can be written as a [[Linear Algebra/06 Span and Linear Independence/6.1 Linear Combination of Vectors\|linear combination]] of the other vectors
> $$
> \vec{b} = x_{1}\vec{a}_{1}+x_{2}\vec{a}_{2}+\dots+x_{n}\vec{a}_{n}
> $$
> for some set of scalars $\{ x_{k} \}^{n}_{k=1} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$.

**Remark.** Generally, when one vector of a set of vectors is linearly dependent, the whole set is linearly dependent.
