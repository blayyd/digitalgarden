# [How to get 100% on every math test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBbUBgp0-do)
1. Do practice problems, especially the test review
2. Redo all the problems correctly without notes

# Jeff's Math Exam Preparation Tips
## 1. Time Management
- Schedule all exam dates by the second in-class meeting.
- Create a "Master Calendar" with all important dates.
- Schedule personal life.
	- ! Try to not plan any major events 10 days before an exam. Ideally, the TWO weekends before an exam should be completely free.

## 2. Build Understanding Daily
- Create well written lecture notes.
- Create full solutions that are easy to understand and follow along.
- @ The more detailed and easy to follow along your work is, the less work you will have to do when preparing for the exam.

## 3. Use Effective Learning Strategies
- Retrieval practice: recalling facts, techniques, and concepts from memory
	- & Spaced repetition!
- Distributed practice: space out study sessions over multiple weeks
- Interleaved practice: mix different ideas together as you practice retrieval, in varying orders
	- ! Don't focus on singular theorems/concepts for extended periods of time
	- Mix skills together: an example would be testing yourself on a definition, solving a problem, and then stating the theorem used to solve that problem. Repeat the cycle in a different order.
	- Mix materials from previous classes!
	- Interleave practice so you have to think critically about what you are doing and not studying on autopilot.
- Varied practice: frequently change the tasks you are working on
	- Change tasks frequently so you don't miss any information
	- *Example:* Instead of focusing on a single problem to study a theorem, try many different problems that involve that theorem.
- Embrace difficulty: when learning is harder, it tends to stick longer

## Avoid Ineffective Strategies
- Avoid block practice
- Avoid rereading text
- Avoid one-off problems
- ! AVOID CRAMMING!!!
