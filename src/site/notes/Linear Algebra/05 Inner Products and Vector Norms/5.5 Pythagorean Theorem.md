> [!theorem|*] Pythagorean Theorem
Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be real numbers representing the lengths of the base, height, and hypotenuse of a triangle respectively. Then,
> $$
> a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}
> $$

`\begin{proof}`
Let $a, b, c$ be appropriate side lengths. Let $\theta$ and $\phi$ represent the two acute angles of our triangle. Then, consider the following shape:

We know the sum of all three interior angles of our triangle sum up to $180\degree = 90\degree + \theta + \phi$. Using four of these triangles, let's construct a special quadrilateral:

Recall that a square's inner angles sum up to $360\degree$ and all of its side lengths are equal. Because we know that $\theta + \phi = 90\degree$, we can immediately conclude that the inner quadrilateral created by these four triangles forms a square with area $c^{2}$. We can also conclude the area of the large square is $(a+b)\cdot(a+b) = a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}$.

In order to get the area of the small square, we can subtract the area of the large square by the area of the 4 triangles.
$$
\begin{align*}
\implies c^{2} &= a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}-4\left( \frac{1}{2}ab \right)\\
&= a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}-2ab\\
&= a^{2}+b^{2}
\end{align*}
$$
We get our Pythagorean Theorem.
