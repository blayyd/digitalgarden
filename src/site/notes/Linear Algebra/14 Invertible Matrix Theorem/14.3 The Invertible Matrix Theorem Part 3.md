> [!theorem|*] The Invertible Matrix Theorem: Part 3
> 
> Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ be a square matrix with real entries. Then, the following statements are equivalent $\iff$. In other words, for a given matrix $A$, the statements are either all true or false.
> 23. The number 0 is not an eigenvalue of $A$.
> 24. The matrix $A$ has $n$ non-zero singular values.
