> [!definition|*] Sign of a Permutation
> 
> Using [[Linear Algebra/16 Determinants/16.2.2 Set of All Inversions for a Given pi in Sn\|16.2.2 Set of All Inversions for a Given pi in Sn]], we can create a function $n:S_{n}\to[n]$ such that $n(\pi)$ gives the number of distinct inversions with respect to $\pi$. Using this output, we can define the **sign** of a permutation $\pi$ to be $\text{sgn}(\pi)=(-1)^{n(\pi)}$. Another way to think of the sign is:
> - Positive if there are an even number of inversions with respect to $\pi$.
> - Negative if there are an odd number of inversions with respect to $\pi$.
