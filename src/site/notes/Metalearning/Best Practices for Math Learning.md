# Best Practices
This is a note of some practices to keep in mind when learning math.

# Theorems
When exploring a new theorem, rewrite the theorem in your own handwriting, translating each claim of conditionality into the 
$$
P \implies Q
$$
structure, and explicitly identify the antecedent(s) $P$ for each consequent $Q$.
