The cross product $A \times B$ is the set of all ordered pairs that can be made by first choosing coordinates from the set $A$ and second coordinates from $B$. The cross product is also known as the **Cartesian Product**.

Elements of the cross products of sets take the form $(a,b)$, known as an **ordered-pair** formed from elements $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.
- **first coordinate:** $a$
- **second coordinate:** $b$

We say two ordered pairs $(a,b)$ and $(x,y)$ are **equal** iff $a=x$ and $b=y$. Changing either coordinate of a given ordered pair $(a,b)$ creates a different ordered pair.
