> [!proposition|*] Solving GLSP Using RREF
> The best way to find general solutions to linear-systems problems is to use row reduction into [[Linear Algebra/18 Solution Sets for General-Linear Systems/18.4 Solution to HSLP using RREF\|18.4 Solution to HSLP using RREF]]. 

To find the solution set for a linear system of equations, we
1. Begin with our original equation
$$
A \cdot \textcolor{red}{\vec{x}} = \vec{b}
$$
2. Reduce the coefficient matrix $A$ into [[Linear Algebra/17 General Linear-Systems/17.3 Reduced Row Echelon Form\|17.3 Reduced Row Echelon Form]] $U = \text{RREF}(A)$ by multiplying $A$ on the left by matrix $E$ yielding
$$
E \cdot A = U
$$
where $E = E_{t} \cdot E_{t-1} \cdots E_{2} \cdot E_{1}$ is a product of elementary matrices $E_{1}, E_{2}, \dots, E_{t}$ and each elementary matrix $E_{J}$ is either a [[Linear Algebra/09 Matrix Arithmetic/9.8 Shear Matrix\|9.8 Shear Matrix]], [[Linear Algebra/09 Matrix Arithmetic/9.10 Transposition Matrix\|9.10 Transposition Matrix]], or a [[Linear Algebra/09 Matrix Arithmetic/9.9 Dilation Matrix\|9.9 Dilation Matrix]] for $j = 1,2,\dots,t$.
3. Simultaneously multiply the same sequence of elementary matrices to the right-hand side to produce the new updated system
$$
U \cdot \textcolor{red}{\vec{x}} = \vec{y}
$$
4. Decide if $\vec{y} \in \text{Span} \{ U(:,k) \}^{n}_{k=1 }$. In other words, verify if $\vec{y}$ can be written as a linear combination of the columns of $U$.
- If $\vec{y} \notin \text{Span} \{ U(:,k) \}_{k=1 }^{n}$, then no exact solution exists to our original linear-system problem $A \cdot \textcolor{red}{\vec{x}}=\vec{b}$.
- If $\vec{y} \in \text{Span}\{ U(:,k) \}_{k=1}^{n}$, then find the general structure for any solution $\vec{x}$ in the form
 $$ \vec{x} = \vec{x}^{*} + \vec{z} $$
where $\vec{x}^{*}$ is a particular solution to $U \cdot \textcolor{red}{\vec{x}}=\vec{y}$ and $\vec{z}$ is a general solution to the [[Linear Algebra/18 Solution Sets for General-Linear Systems/18.3 Homogenous Linear System\|18.3 Homogenous Linear System]] $U \cdot \textcolor{red}{\vec{x}}=0$.

This algorithm produces every possible solution to [[Linear Algebra/17 General Linear-Systems/17.1 The General Linear-Systems Problem\|17.1 The General Linear-Systems Problem]].
