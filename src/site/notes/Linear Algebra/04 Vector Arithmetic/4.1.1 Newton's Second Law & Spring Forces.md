> Let's return to our our Hooke's Law example where we measured how mass moved when hung on the end of a spring. We can calculate the spring forces using **Newton's Second Law**. 

*Solution.* We have our mass vector $\vec{m}$. Through Newton's Second Law, we know:
$$
\underset{ \text{force} (N) }{ f } = \underset{ \text{mass (kg)} }{ m } \cdot \underset{ \text{acceleration } \left( \frac{m}{s^{2}} \right) }{ a }
$$
The springs are being pulled down by gravity, which accelerates at $9.8 \frac{m}{s^{2}}$. We can plug our mass vector $\vec{m}$ and the acceleration of gravity into the force equation to get our vector of spring forces.
$$
\vec{f} = \vec{m} \cdot 9.8
$$
Multiplying $\vec{m} \cdot 9.8$ is [[Linear Algebra/04 Vector Arithmetic/4.1 Scalar-Vector Multiplication\|4.1 Scalar-Vector Multiplication]] because $9.8$ is a scalar value. We now have a way of calculating the forces!
$$
\vec{f} = \begin{bmatrix}
m_{1} \\
m_{2} \\
\vdots \\
m_{n}
\end{bmatrix} \cdot 9.8 = \begin{bmatrix}
m_{1} \cdot 9.8 \\
m_{2} \cdot 9.8 \\
\vdots \\
m_{n} \cdot 9.8
\end{bmatrix}
$$
